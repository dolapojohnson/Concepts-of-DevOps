1. Plan:
The planning stage involves defining the objectives, requirements, and scope of the software project. This includes gathering user stories, prioritizing features, and creating a roadmap for development. Teams collaborate to establish clear goals and timelines for delivering value to customers.

2. Develop:
In the development stage, developers write code to implement the features and functionalities defined in the planning phase. They follow coding standards, best practices, and version control workflows to ensure code quality and maintainability. Continuous Integration (CI) practices are employed to merge code changes frequently and detect integration errors early.

3. Build:
The build stage involves compiling source code, running automated tests, and generating deployable artifacts. Build automation tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD are used to automate the build process. Automated tests include unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests to verify the functionality and quality of the software.

4. Test:
Testing is performed at multiple levels to validate the software's functionality, performance, and security. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Test automation tools and frameworks like Selenium, JUnit, and PyTest are used to automate test execution and ensure consistent test coverage.

5. Deploy:
The deployment stage involves releasing the software to production or staging environments. Continuous Deployment (CD) practices automate the deployment process, enabling teams to deploy changes quickly and reliably. Deployment automation tools such as Ansible, Puppet, or Kubernetes help configure infrastructure and deploy application artifacts across environments.

6. Monitor:
Monitoring is essential for tracking the performance, availability, and health of the software system in real-time. Monitoring tools collect metrics, logs, and events from various components of the system, allowing teams to detect anomalies, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues proactively. DevOps teams use monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or commercial APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools.

7. Feedback:
Feedback loops are integral to the DevOps process, enabling teams to gather insights, learn from experiences, and continuously improve. Feedback mechanisms include user feedback, post-incident reviews, performance metrics, and stakeholder input. Teams analyze feedback to identify areas for improvement, prioritize enhancements, and iterate on the software delivery pipeline.

8. Iterate:
The DevOps process is iterative and iterative, with teams continuously refining their practices, tools, and workflows based on feedback and experience. Iteration involves experimenting with new technologies, adopting emerging best practices, and adapting to changing requirements and market dynamics. Continuous improvement is a core principle of DevOps, driving innovation, efficiency, and resilience.
